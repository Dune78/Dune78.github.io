        <h1>Get ready for the hunt!</h1>
        <p id="description"> Hello to all little cubs out there! Weclome to the hunting game, where you have to fight in order to eat, and survive for your own life! Now I know it sounds crule because most of us are going to be hunting and fighting each other for our breakfast, lunch, and dinners. Well tough luck! That's how it is in the food chain and within the animal world! We must become predatros in order to survive; for that way we can live! Now, here are the rules to this games. One: All players must hunt alone, until they are within pack or form one of their own. Either way it's your choice. Two:Every wolf is going to start off as a Beta or an Omega; mostly an Omega since you're hunting alone in the begining of the game. Three: Watch out for enemies, there are more creatures out there than you little cublings. And finally stay alive the best that you can!</p>
