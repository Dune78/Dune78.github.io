        <h1>Hunting a Deer </h1>
        <p id="description">
            Deers are one of the most easitest preys to capture-even for an Omega without a pack. They mostly reside in the forest, where they walk around and about, however, there are some that do hunt for berries and are seen drinking in the river. Now for Deers that roam around the forest, you'll need to use your senses in order to find capture it. Just use your nose and listen carefully for any sound or scent that you might pick up; it really helps alot in hunting for other wild animals even predatros as well. Just remeber that we animal know how to feel for our prey and anything else aroind us. That is our specialty
