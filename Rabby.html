        <p id="description">
            Rabits are one of the most hardest creatures to capture, because they can use their holes to hide in and they'll know when you're out there or not. So the trick-is to hide your presence and make sure they don't spot you. If they do, feel free to chase one around until you captured it. However, there are advantages you have.</p>
